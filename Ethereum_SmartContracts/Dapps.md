# Ethereum: Distributed Applications (Dapps)
# Architecture
Dapps usually consist of a front- and a back-end architecture with interactions with a smart contract (SC) on the blockchain. The fornt end is outside of the blockchain, but it commiunicates with the SC via artefacts generated by the complier. The back-end may o rmay not be on the blockchain. The front-end may be anything form a Command Line Interface (CLI) to a mobile app on a smartphone.

## Ethereum Blockchain Server
The highlevel Dapps Stack looks as follows:
1. End User Applications
2. Smart Contracts
3. Ethereum Blockchain and EVM
4. P2P-Network and OS
5. Hardware
The blochain server entails the infrastructure and the functionality that the blockchain provides.
