# Ethereum: Distributed Applications (Dapps)
# Architecture
Dapps usually consist of a front- and a back-end architecture with interactions with a smart contract (SC) on the blockchain. The fornt end is outside of the blockchain, but it commiunicates with the SC via artefacts generated by the complier. The back-end may or may not be on the blockchain. The front-end may be anything form a Command Line Interface (CLI) to a mobile app on a smartphone.

## Ethereum Blockchain Server
The highlevel Dapps Stack looks as follows:
1. End User Applications
2. Smart Contracts
3. Ethereum Blockchain and EVM
4. P2P-Network and OS
5. Hardware
The blochain server entails the infrastructure and the functionality that the blockchain provides.

## Ethereum API
The Blockhain Server provides the functionalities and the API provides the access of the Dapp to the Blockchain Server functionalities.
Ethereum support two sorts of APIs:
1. Ethereum Node Management API e.g. admin, debug, and miner
 1.1 admin: allows to work with geth instance (the node), for example RPC end-point management
 1.2 debug: helps to get inspect records on the blockchain
 1.3 miner: helps to control the node's mining operation
 1.4 personal: enables the management of accounts on a node 
 1.5 txpool: provides access to the pool of all currently pending transactions and the transacions queued for future processing
2. Web3 API: web3, eth, and net
